Problem 1
Build a stand-alone web page as shown in WeGiveBack.jpg. The page header, footer, and side navigation are the
same as our current website template, whose code can be reused in your solution. The focus of your work is on the
main contents within that template.

The top part of the page, just under the page title, is a rotating banner. This section updates itself every 4 seconds
with a different picture from a set of three, and the 3 circles below them also change colors to indicate the current
picture's position within the sequence. We are not providing the set of 3 pictures, but you can make your own
dummy images to demonstrate the rotating functionality.

The remainder of the page is static pictures and text.
Within the main contents (excluding the common template), you are expected to slice all images within, enter the
text, and position them exactly as shown. Use Arial as the default font. All the links in the outer template must be
preserved.

Problem 2
The top navigation in our common template is a one-step hover menu expansion (screenshot below). "One-step"
means that it takes only one hover action (over the word "HEATING") to display all sub-headings and items under
that menu.
